                    <h2>SO YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE?</h2>
                    <p>I guess you want to know a little bit more about me.</p>

                        <h3>> I like to code</h3>
                        <p>I've been coding since I was like 14, but that was in Python and I was only making a simple
                            Python Discord bot.</p>
                        <p>Later on I decided to go to an IT school, and started coding a lot since then. I learnt Java
                            there,
                            but I know C# some Python and know how to make websites :D</p>

                        <h3>> So what's my favorite programming language?</h3>
                        <p>Currently it has to be C# just because I'm using it more than Java. Though I love Java
                            through and through just because of me learning it in school. Also making Minecraft mods is
                            quite fun. I would like to make an actual good, high effort Minecraft mod.</p>

                        <h3>> What browser do I use?</h3>
                        <p>I started with Chrome, probably like most people. However I switched to Brave after a friend
                            recommended it to me. I have then used Brave for like 5 years I think? and decided it's time
                            for a change and started using Firefox. Not gonna lie, Firefox is quite nice. It's quite
                            nostalgic to me, as my grandpa uses it and has been using it for decades now.</p>
